🤖 AutoFlow Agent — Intelligent Automation with LLMs & Web Control
AutoFlow Agent is a smart, autonomous agent that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain, Puppeteer, and Pinecone to automate repetitive web tasks like logging in, filling forms, and scraping data — all through natural instructions and memory-based workflows.

This agent not only saves time but acts as a hands-free virtual assistant to streamline daily operations on the web.
